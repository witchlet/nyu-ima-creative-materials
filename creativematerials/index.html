												<h3>electronic musician★3D artist
												<br>she★they★he</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Hi! I'm Julie. I lied about my preferred name on my application — sorry about that.
											I've been writing music for 5 years and creating 3D art for slightly over two months.
											With my work, I aim to create engaging and overwhelming worlds of silliness, catharsis, and childlike wonder.

									<h2>Selected Music</h2>
								</header>
									<p style="text-align:left;">This section contains my best music. Many of my songs are sample-based.
										However, unless otherwise stated, they primarily feature my own original songwriting. In this assortment, the first four tracks have sampled vocals instead of my own.
											The samples used are listed in the description of each piece on SoundCloud, which is accessible by clicking on the tracks' titles.
											I decided to create a selection because I do not expect an admissions officer to have the time to listen to all of my music.</p>
									<h3>Headphones recommended over speakers for the best experience.<br><strong>*HIGH VOLUME WARNING*</strong></h3>

												<p style="text-align:left;">This song is a practice in absurdity and juxtaposition, particularly regarding dynamics and mood, that creates an engaging and fun atmosphere. 
													Dreamy, minimal synths immediately interrupt the track's intense hyperactivity throughout its runtime.
													Through this opposition, in conjunction with the electronic soundscapes and post-ironic sampling of songs popular on TikTok, this piece aims to capture internet addiction and overstimulation.</p>

												<p style="text-align:left;">Dubbed as "the worst song I've ever heard" by my junior year psychology teacher (I personally disagree), 
													this song is a fast-paced, ever-morphing experience grounded only by its tempo and nearly constant volume. 
													It reuporposes audio with diverse emotional palettes, such as Mitski's bitter "Washing Machine Heart" and Mei's panicked dialogue in <em>Turning Red</em>,
													into a hyperactive, spontaneous track as an act of grappling with and overcoming negative emotions.</p>

												<p style="text-align:left;">With this piece, I aim to evoke an undeniable sense of fun and excitement.
													I do this by drawing from various nostalgic aesthetics, such as nightcore and retro bitcrushing.
													Parts of this song toy with tension and dissonance.
													It doesn't shy away from potentially being unpleasant; it invites it, and it uses that discomfort to make the rest of the song more gratifying.
													</p>

												<p style="text-align:left;">This song mainly samples vocals from Ice Spice and acts as an homage toward her.
													Additionally, as the first track on my unfinished "pabucore" compilation, it serves to establish the aesthetics that I will maintain, develop, and subvert for the rest of the record
													— those being genre-bending experimentation, internet culture, non-sequitur musical passages, and high intensity.</p>

												<p style="text-align:left;">This piece portrays the gradually shifting feelings of having a crush.
													To accomplish this, I experiment heavily with progressively melancholy vocals, dynamics, and sonic palettes.
													Through this, I aim to communicate cognitive dissonance, sorrow, and self-aware melodrama.</p>

												<p style="text-align:left;">This track works to push the pop music trope of sad lyrics with happy instrumentation to its extreme.
												A repetitive and bouncy instrumental accompanies me yelling out
												"Did you even notice / that you led me on or / am I so pathetic that you didn't even have to try?".
												These lyrics are chipmunked, bitcrushed, and not at all understandable to
												exaggerate the obscured meaning that the aforementioned trope achieves.
												However, I also attempt to breathe new life into the practice:
												I hope the impossibly high, potentially annoying energy of this song wears the listener out in the same way that the lyrical content wears me out.</p>

												<p style="text-align:left;">The oldest of the list, this song, along the album it is a part of, was created throughout the peak of quarantine.
													In it, I sing about feeling unworthy of even deserving a funeral, dissatisfaction with life, and gaslighting.
													Truthfully, the lyrics are messy and lack polish, but they perfectly mirror how I felt at the time.
													This song, beyond its message, also shows how I have evolved over time — both emotionally and musically.
